## Installation

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephj/tinder/master/install.sh | sh
```

This will automatically create a folder with random name. 

1. Go into the folder.
2. Start webserver by executing `gulp server`.
3. Do some modification in another window or tab. `vim app/demo.html`
