Tinder
---------

A convenient tool which helps me to create prototype rapidly.

## Why not?

There are several existed tools which facilitates developer to create prototype.
Why not just use these tools?

* `Yeoman`: It contains too many things which are not necessary.
* `Fire.app`: I dislike GUI. CLI is awesome!

## Installation

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephj/tinder/master/install.sh
```
